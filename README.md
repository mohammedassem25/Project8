# Project8
The Cars_Data Project. Here we will learn about how to select a new car based on different criteria between all car' makes and models using Tableau Desktop.
Firstly, I started to identify the basic specifications for different car makes and models. Then, I identified about different factors affect the car's horsepower based on drivetrain system and origin of car. After that, I select 3 different criteria to determine best car selection based on largest MSRP, No. of Cylinders, and Avg. of MPG City. And finally, I identified the most effective factors on Total MSRP for different Car' Makes in terms of Type, Origin, and DriveTrain.
